## Design Considerations ##

Editor Blocks look better with a wide layout, we recommend using a 'Full Width' page template if your theme has one. We've also built a (free) companion theme you can use:
[Editor Blocks Theme](http://wordpress.org/themes/editor-blocks)
[Editor Blocks Theme Setup](http://editorblockswp.com/theme-setup)

## Development ##
1. Clone the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/editorblocks/editor-blocks.git`
2. Browse to the folder in the command line.
3. Run the `npm install` command to install the plugin's dependencies within a /node_modules/ folder.
4. Run the `npm start` command for development.
5. Run the `build` gulp task to process build files and generate a zip.

## Create Guten Block ## 

Editor Blocks wouldn't have been possible without the work of @ahmadawais.

>`create-guten-block` is _zero configuration dev-toolkit_ (#0CJS) to develop WordPress Gutenberg blocks in a matter of minutes without configuring `React`, `webpack`, `ES6/7/8/Next`, `ESLint`, `Babel`, etc.
